            <!--About Delhi Metro-->
            <h2><b>About Delhi Metro</b></h2>
            <p>The Delhi Metro has been instrumental in ushering in a new era in the sphere of mass 
                urban transportation in India. The swanky and modern Metro system introduced comfortable, 
                air conditioned and eco-friendly services for the first time in India and completely 
                revolutionized the mass transportation scenario not only in the National Capital Region 
                but the entire country.<br><br>

                Having constructed a massive network of about 373 Km with 271 stations in record time in
                 Delhi, NCR, the DMRC today stands out as a shining example of how a mammoth technically 
                 complex infrastructure project can be completed before time and within budgeted cost by
                  a Government agency.<br><br>
                    
                    The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) was registered on 3rd May 1995 under the
                     Companies Act, 1956 with equal equity participation of the Government of the National
                      Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) and the Central Government to implement the dream 
                      of construction and operation of a world- class Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS).<br><br>
                    
                    The DMRC opened its first corridor between Shahdara and Tis Hazari on 25th December, 2002.
                     Subsequently, the first phase of construction worth 65 kilometres of Metro lines was 
                     finished two years and nine months ahead of schedule in 2005. Since then the DMRC has
                      also completed the construction of another 125 kilometres of Metro corridors under
                       the second phase in only four and a half years.<br><br>
                    
                    Presently, the Delhi Metro network consists of about 373 Km with 271 stations.
                     The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach NOIDA and Ghaziabad
                      in Uttar Pradesh, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh and Ballabhgarh in Haryana. With the
                       opening of the Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar and Janakpuri West - Botanical Garden Sections,
                        new age trains equipped with the Unattended Train Operation (UTO) technology have been
                         introduced. These trains operate with the Communication Based Train Control(CBTC)
                          signaling technology which facilitate movement of trains in very short frequencies.
                           This network also includes the NOIDA - Greater NOIDA Aqua Line. The Aqua Line has 
                           been constructed by DMRC on behalf of the NOIDA Metro Rail Corporation and is also 
                           being operated by DMRC currently. In addition, the 11.7 kilometre long Rapid Metro 
                           also connects with the Delhi Metro network at Sikanderpur station of Yellow Line.
                            The Rapid Metro provides connectivity within the satellite city of Gurugram.<br><br>
                    
                    The Airport Express link between the Indira Gandhi International Airport and New Delhi 
                    has now propelled Delhi to the league of global cities which have high speed rail 
                    connectivity between the city and the airport. The DMRC today has over 300 train sets of 
                    four, six and eight coaches.<br><br>
                    
                    The Delhi Metro has also contributed tremendously on the environment front by becoming the 
                    first ever railway project in the world to claim carbon credits for regenerative braking.
                     DMRC has also been certified by the United Nations (UN) as the first Metro Rail and Rail 
                     based system in the world to get carbon Credits for reducing Green House gas emissions as
                      it has helped to reduce pollution levels in the city by 6.3 lakh tons every year thus 
                      helping in reducing global warming.<br><br>
                    
                    It has also set up roof top solar power plants at many of its stations. All stations of
                     the presently under construction corridors are being constructed as green buildings. In
                      the present phase of Delhi Metro’s construction, the DMRC is nearing the completion of 
                      160 kilometres of Metro lines which has woven a web of Metro corridors along the city’s 
                      Ring Road besides connecting with many other localities in NOIDA, Ghaziabad, Bahadurgarh
                       and Ballabhgarh.<br><br>
                    
                    Apart from providing Delhites with a comfortable public transport option, the Delhi Metro
                     is also contributing significantly towards controlling pollution as well as reducing 
                     vehicular congestion on the roads.</p>
